## ℹ️ About the Project

[Swetrix](https://swetrix.com) is an open source, privacy-focused and cookie-less alternative to Google Analytics. Swetrix is designed to be easy to use while providing all the features you need to understand your website users. With Swetrix you can track your site's traffic, monitor your site's speed, analyse user sessions and page flows, see user flows and much more!

Swetrix is made in the 🇬🇧 United Kingdom, and is hosted on Hetzner in 🇩🇪 Germany. Here's our [live demo with our own website statistics](https://swetrix.com/projects/STEzHcB1rALV).

We are a bootstrapped company that is passionate about privacy and open source, funded solely by our subscribers.

## ✨ Why Swetrix?

We've been building Swetrix since 2021 with a goal to make web analytics simple and respectful of your users' privacy.

- **Privacy‑first and cookieless**: GDPR‑compliant by design. We don't use cookies, cross-device tracking, all the data is stored anonymised. Read more in our [Data Policy](https://swetrix.com/data-policy) page.
- **Lightweight and fast**: a small tracking script and a snappy, real‑time dashboard.
- **Core insights that matter**: top pages, geolocation, map visualisation, devices, traffic sources and UTM campaigns.
- **Custom events and properties**: track conversions, sales, or key user actions with your own semantics.
- **Session analytics and user flows**: understand journeys and behaviour across your site.
- **Funnels**: visualise drop‑offs and improve conversion rates.
- **Performance monitoring**: real‑user metrics (e.g. TTFB, DNS, TLS, render) to keep sites fast.
- **Error tracking**: capture client‑side errors with details and aggregated views.
- **Shareable analytics**: public or password‑protected dashboards; invite teammates with roles, or manage access with organisations.
- **Data portability**: export to CSV and access data via our [developer API](https://docs.swetrix.com/statistics-api).
- **Alerts & notifications (Cloud)**: get notified on thresholds via Slack, Telegram or Discord.
- **Feature flags**: manage feature rollouts and conduct safe releases.
- **Experiments (Cloud)**: run A/B tests and experiments to optimize your site.
- **Revenue analytics (Cloud)**: track MRR, churn and other financial metrics.
- **Ask AI (Cloud)**: chat with your data to uncover insights.
- **Goals**: track specific conversion goals and objectives.
- **DAU/MAU tracking**: keep an eye on your daily and monthly active users.
- Open source and self‑hostable, with a fully managed EU‑hosted Cloud option.

## 🚀 Getting Started

The easiest way to get started with Swetrix is by using [our cloud service](https://swetrix.com). We do all the work for you: hosting, maintenance, backups, worldwide CDN, etc. Using Cloud you still own the data, you can export it or delete it at any time you want. It's GDPR‑compliant, hosted in the EU (Germany), with a free trial available.

We're an independent and bootstrapped company, your subscription to Swetrix Cloud directly supports maintenance and development of the project, which eventually makes it better.

- Start using Cloud: https://swetrix.com (starts at $19/mo with a free trial available)
- Explore docs: https://docs.swetrix.com

### Selfhosting

Prefer to run it yourself? Swetrix Community Edition (CE) ships the same core analytics: privacy‑friendly traffic stats, custom events, sessions, funnels, performance and error tracking. Use Docker to deploy the API and UI, connect MySQL/ClickHouse/Redis, and you're ready to go.

## Tech Stack

Backend / API is built as a standard Nest.js application. We use MySQL with TypeORM for general data (accounts, projects, etc.), and Clickhouse for analytics data. Redis is used for caching.

Frontend is built using React Router framework. We use Tailwind CSS for styling and billboard.js for charts.

The [browser tracking script](https://github.com/Swetrix/swetrix-js) is built with TypeScript and rollup for bundling.
