Hey there,<br /><br />

Just a heads up - your Swetrix trial ends in about 48 hours, and since you've
cancelled, your subscription won't activate automatically.<br /><br />

Once the trial ends, your dashboard will be locked and you'll lose access to
your analytics data. Your projects and data won't be deleted, but you won't be
able to view them until you subscribe to a plan.<br /><br />

If you've changed your mind, you can
<a href="{{url}}" target="_blank">subscribe from your billing page</a> before
the trial ends to keep everything running.<br /><br />

Got questions? Just reply to this email — we're happy to help.<br /><br />
