Hey there,<br /><br />

Just a heads up - your free Swetrix trial ends in about 48 hours.<br /><br />

Most companies don't email you before your trial expires because they hope you'll forget and get charged anyway. We're doing the opposite — we don't want your money if you don't want to give it to us.<br /><br />

If you're loving Swetrix, you don't need to do anything. Your subscription will begin automatically and you'll keep getting privacy-first analytics without interruption.<br /><br />

If it's not the right fit, no hard feelings. You can <a href="{{url}}" target="_blank">cancel from your billing page</a> before the trial ends and you won't be charged.<br /><br />

Got questions about your plan, features, or anything else? Just reply to this email — we're here to help.<br /><br />

Andrii Romasiun,
Swetrix
