Gather design context for this project, then persist it for all future sessions.

## Step 1: Explore the Codebase

Before asking questions, thoroughly scan the project to discover what you can:

- **README and docs**: Project purpose, target audience, any stated goals
- **Package.json / config files**: Tech stack, dependencies, existing design libraries
- **Existing components**: Current design patterns, spacing, typography in use
- **Brand assets**: Logos, favicons, color values already defined
- **Design tokens / CSS variables**: Existing color palettes, font stacks, spacing scales
- **Any style guides or brand documentation**

Note what you've learned and what remains unclear.

## Step 2: Ask UX-Focused Questions

ask the user directly to clarify what you cannot infer. Focus only on what you couldn't infer from the codebase:

### Users & Purpose
- Who uses this? What's their context when using it?
- What job are they trying to get done?
- What emotions should the interface evoke? (confidence, delight, calm, urgency, etc.)

### Brand & Personality
- How would you describe the brand personality in 3 words?
- Any reference sites or apps that capture the right feel? What specifically about them?
- What should this explicitly NOT look like? Any anti-references?

### Aesthetic Preferences
- Any strong preferences for visual direction? (minimal, bold, elegant, playful, technical, organic, etc.)
- Light mode, dark mode, or both?
- Any colors that must be used or avoided?

### Accessibility & Inclusion
- Specific accessibility requirements? (WCAG level, known user needs)
- Considerations for reduced motion, color blindness, or other accommodations?

Skip questions where the answer is already clear from the codebase exploration.

## Step 3: Write Design Context

Synthesize your findings and the user's answers into a `## Design Context` section:

```markdown
## Design Context

### Users
[Who they are, their context, the job to be done]

### Brand Personality
[Voice, tone, 3-word personality, emotional goals]

### Aesthetic Direction
[Visual tone, references, anti-references, theme]

### Design Principles
[3-5 principles derived from the conversation that should guide all design decisions]
```

Write this section to .cursorrules in the project root. If the file exists, append or update the Design Context section.

Confirm completion and summarize the key design principles that will now guide all future work.
