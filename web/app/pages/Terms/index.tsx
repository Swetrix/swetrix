        <h3 className='mt-4 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50'>Accounts</h3>
        <p className='text-lg tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50'>
          When you create an account with us, you must provide us information that is accurate, complete, and current at
          all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of

          You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any activities or
          actions under your password, whether your password is with our Service or a third-party service.
          <br />

        <h3 className='mt-4 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50'>Subscriptions</h3>
        <p className='text-lg tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50'>
          Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in
          advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or
          annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.
          <br />
          At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions
          unless you cancel it or we cancel it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online
          account management page or by contacting our customer support team.
          <br />
          A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You
          shall provide us with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code,
          telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you
          automatically authorize us to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment
          instruments.
          <br />
          Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, we may issue an electronic invoice indicating that you
          must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing
          period as indicated on the invoice.
        </p>

        <h3 className='mt-4 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50'>Fee changes</h3>
        <p className='text-lg tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50'>
          We may, at our sole discretion and at any time, modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any
          Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
          <br />
          We will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an
          opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.
          <br />
          Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your
          agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.
        </p>

        <h3 className='mt-4 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50'>Refunds</h3>
        <p className='text-lg tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50'>
          To avoid being charged for your Subscription, you must cancel the Subscription before your renewal date.
          Otherwise, you’ll be charged and will retain access to the Service through the end of the Billing Cycle.
          <br />
          Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable. However, you may contact our support
          team and at our sole discretion we may issue a refund on a case-by-case basis.
        </p>

        <h3 className='mt-4 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50'>Governing Law</h3>
        <p className='text-lg tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50'>
          These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Scotland, without regard to its
          conflict of law provisions.
          <br />
          Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights.

          these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our
          Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the Service.

          Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an obligation under
          this Agreement shall not affect a party’s ability to exercise such right or require such performance at any
          time thereafter, nor shall the waiver of a breach constitute the waiver of any subsequent breach.
        </p>
