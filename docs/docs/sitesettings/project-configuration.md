Beyond the basics of tracking, Swetrix offers a robust set of configuration options to secure your data, manage access, and customise your project settings.

To access these settings, go to your **Project Settings** page. You can learn how to access it [here](/how-to-access-site-settings).

## General Settings

The **General** tab allows you to configure the basic identity of your project.

- **Project Name**: A friendly name for your project (e.g., "My Personal Blog").
- **Website URL**: The main URL of the website you are tracking.
- **Project ID**: A unique identifier for your project (read-only).
- **Sharable Link**: A direct link to your public or password-protected dashboard (read-only).

## Security (Shields)

The **Shields** tab provides powerful tools to protect your analytics from spam, bots, and unwanted traffic.

### Origins

By default, Swetrix accepts events from any domain. If you want to restrict tracking to specific domains only, you can add them here.

- Enter one domain per line.
- Requests from domains not listed here will be rejected.
- Leave empty to allow all domains (default).

### IP Blacklist

You can block traffic from specific IP addresses to exclude them from your analytics (e.g., your own office IP).

- Enter one IP address per line.
- Supports both IPv4 and IPv6.

### Country Blacklist

If you want to completely ignore traffic from specific countries, you can add them to the blacklist.

- Select countries from the dropdown menu.
- Traffic from these countries will not be recorded.

### Bot Protection Level

Swetrix has built-in bot detection. You can adjust the strictness of this protection:

- **Basic**: Standard protection against common bots and crawlers.
- **Strict**: More aggressive filtering. May result in fewer recorded visits but cleaner data.

## Access Control

The **Access** tab manages who can see your data and which team owns the project.

### Visibility Settings

- **Enabled**: Toggles data collection on or off. If disabled, no new events will be recorded.
- **Public Dashboard**: If enabled, anyone with the link can view your analytics dashboard. No login required.
- **Password Protected**: If enabled, visitors must enter a password to view the dashboard. Useful for sharing stats with clients without requiring them to create an account.

### Organisation Assignment

If you are a member of an Organisation (Team), you can transfer the project to that organisation here. This allows all members of the organisation to access the project according to their roles.

## Danger Zone

The **Danger Zone** contains destructive actions. Proceed with caution.

- **Transfer Project**: Move ownership of the project to another user. See [Transfer Ownership](/how-to-transfer-ownership-of-your-website) for details.
- **Reset Data**: Clear all or some of your analytics data. See [Reset Site Data](/reset-sites-data) for details.
- **Delete Project**: Permanently delete the project and all associated data. **This action cannot be undone.**
