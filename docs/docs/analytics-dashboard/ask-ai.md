Ask AI is a powerful feature that allows you to query your analytics data using natural language. Instead of manually filtering and analyzing complex datasets, you can simply ask a question and get immediate insights.

## How it works

Ask AI uses advanced language models to understand your questions and translate them into queries against your analytics data. It can help you find trends, anomalies, and specific metrics without needing to know the underlying query language or navigate through multiple dashboard views.

## Examples

You can ask questions like:

- "How many unique visitors did we have last week?"
- "What is the most popular page in the US?"
- "Compare the conversion rate of mobile vs. desktop users."
- "Show me a breakdown of traffic sources for the 'Signup' event."

## Usage

1. Navigate to the **Ask AI** tab in your project dashboard.
2. Type your question in the input box.
3. Review the generated answer and data visualization.

Ask AI is designed to make data accessibility easier for everyone on your team, regardless of their technical expertise.
