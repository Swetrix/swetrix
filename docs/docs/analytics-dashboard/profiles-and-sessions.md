title: Individual User Insights (Profiles & Sessions)
---

The Profiles and Sessions tabs allow for a granular view of user behavior, helping you understand individual user journeys and debug specific issues.

## Profiles

The **Profiles** tab lists all unique visitors to your website within the selected time period. Each row represents a unique user (or profile).

### Understanding the Profiles List

For each profile, you can see:

- **Profile ID**: A unique identifier for the user. If the user is identified (e.g., logged in), this might display their name or email if you have set up User Identification.
- **Status**:
  - **Online**: User is currently active (green indicator).
  - **Recently Active**: User was active in the last 30 minutes (yellow indicator).
  - **Offline**: User has not been active recently.
- **Metadata**: Country, Operating System, and Browser.
- **Stats**: Total sessions, pageviews, events, and errors associated with this profile.
- **Last Seen**: The date and time the user was last active.

### Filtering Profiles

You can filter the profiles list to find specific users or segments:

1.  **User Type**: Use the toggle buttons at the top to filter by:
    - **All Users**: Show everyone.
    - **Anonymous**: Show only users who haven't been identified.
    - **Identified**: Show only users with a User ID.

2.  **General Filters**: Use the main dashboard filters (top bar) to narrow down by:
    - **Country / Region / City**
    - **Browser / OS / Device**
    - **Source / Medium / Campaign**
    - **Custom Events**

This is particularly useful for finding users who experienced specific bugs (e.g., filter by "Browser: Safari" if you suspect a Safari-specific issue).

## Profile Details

Clicking on any profile in the list opens the **Profile Details** view. This view provides a comprehensive history of that specific user's interaction with your site.

### Overview & Activity Calendar

The top section shows a summary of the user:

- **First Seen & Last Seen**: When they first visited and when they were last active.
- **Total Revenue**: If you are tracking revenue, the total amount generated by this user.
- **Activity Calendar**: A heat map visualization (similar to GitHub contributions) showing the user's activity intensity over the last few months. This helps you quickly identify when the user is most active.

### Session History

Below the overview, you will see a list of all **Sessions** for this user. A session represents a continuous period of activity.

For each session, you can see:

- **Duration**: How long the session lasted.
- **Entry & Exit Pages**: Where they started and ended their session.
- **Timeline**: A step-by-step log of every pageview and custom event within that session.

This "User Journey" view is incredibly powerful for:

- **Debugging**: See exactly what steps a user took before encountering an error.
- **UX Analysis**: Understand common paths users take and where they might be getting stuck or dropping off.

## Sessions Tab

While the **Profiles** tab groups activity by user, the **Sessions** tab lists all individual sessions from all users chronologically.

Use this view when you want to analyze global session trends or spot anomalies across the entire user base, rather than focusing on specific individuals.
