To use Swetrix on your website, you need to add a tracking script to your website and there are several ways to do this.

<Callout type="info" title="Using a CMS or site builder?">

If your website runs on WordPress, Wix, Shopify, Webflow, or another CMS/site builder, use a dedicated integration guide instead of editing HTML manually.

See [CMS & website builder integrations](/integrations#cms--website-builders).

</Callout>

<Tabs items={["HTML script tag", "npm package"]}>
<Tab value="HTML script tag">

The easiest way to add the tracking script to your website is to edit the HTML code of your website.
To do this, paste the following code snippet into the Body section (`<body>` tag). You have to place the script within the `<body>...</body>` tags.

```html
<script src="https://swetrix.org/swetrix.js" defer></script>
<script>
  document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
    swetrix.init("YOUR_PROJECT_ID");
    swetrix.trackViews();
  });
</script>

<noscript>
  <img
    src="https://api.swetrix.com/log/noscript?pid=YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
    alt=""
    referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"
  />
</noscript>
```

<Callout type="warn">
It's important to remember to replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with your actual Project ID, which you can find in the Dashboard, otherwise tracking will not work!

</Callout>

Done. Now you can start using Swetrix on your website.

<Tab value="npm package">

If you are using a website based on a JavaScript framework such as React or Vue, you can install Swetrix via npm and use it on your website.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Install the package

```bash
npm install swetrix
```

</Step>
<Step>
### Import Swetrix

Import the module into your project's root file (in React this is usually called `index.js` or `App.js`, and these files are located in the `src` folder):

```js
import * as Swetrix from "swetrix";
```

</Step>
<Step>
### Start tracking

After that you can track anything you want. For example, the following code snippet will work just fine:

```js
Swetrix.init("YOUR_PROJECT_ID");
Swetrix.trackViews();
```
