Annotations allow you to mark specific dates on your analytics charts with notes. This is useful for tracking how real-world events—like a new marketing campaign, a product launch, or a server outage—correlate with changes in your traffic or performance data.

### Creating an annotation

You can create an annotation directly from any time-series chart on your dashboard.

1. Navigate to your project's dashboard.
2. **Right-click** on the specific date point on the chart where you want to add a note.
3. Select **Add annotation** from the context menu.

/>

A modal will appear where you can enter the details:

- **Date**: The date for the annotation (pre-filled based on where you clicked).
- **Note**: A short description of the event (max 120 characters).

Click **Save** to create the annotation.

> **Note:** Please avoid including sensitive personal information in annotations, as they may be visible to other team members with access to the project.

### Managing annotations

You can view, edit, and delete all annotations for a project from the settings page.

1. Go to your project settings.
2. Navigate to the **Annotations** tab.

Here you will see a list of all annotations created for this project, sorted by date.

#### Editing an annotation

To edit an existing annotation:

1. Find the annotation in the list.
2. Click the **Edit** (pencil) icon.
3. Update the date or text in the modal and click **Save**.

#### Deleting an annotation

To remove an annotation:

1. Find the annotation in the list.
2. Click the **Delete** (trash bin) icon.
3. Confirm the action in the dialog that appears.

### Permissions

Only project owners and administrators (managers) can create, edit, or delete annotations. View-only members will be able to see the annotations on the charts but cannot modify them.
