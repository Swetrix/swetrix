Swetrix allows you to track revenue generated by your users, giving you insights into your project's financial performance alongside your analytics data.

## Overview

Revenue tracking enables you to:

- Monitor total revenue and trends over time.
- Attribute revenue to specific users (profiles).
- Integrate seamlessly with payment providers like Stripe and Paddle.

## Configuration

To set up revenue tracking:

1. Go to your project dashboard.
2. Navigate to **Project Settings**.
3. Click on the **Revenue** tab.

Here you can connect your Stripe or Paddle account. Once connected, Swetrix will automatically start tracking revenue events associated with your project.

## User Attribution

To correctly attribute revenue to specific users, you need to ensure that the user's `profileId` is consistent between Swetrix and your payment provider.

Swetrix generates a `profileId` for users (or you can supply your own). When a user makes a purchase, you should ensure that this identifier is passed to the payment provider so that the revenue event can be linked back to the correct user profile in Swetrix.

For more details on handling `profileId` in your application, refer to the [Script Reference](/swetrix-js-reference#init).
