Segments (also known as Saved Views) allow you to save a specific configuration of filters and custom metrics for quick access. Instead of manually reapplying the same filters every time you visit your dashboard, you can simply switch to a saved Segment.

## Creating a Segment

1.  **Apply Filters**: Set up the dashboard exactly how you want it. This includes:
    - Date ranges and time buckets.
    - Specific filters (e.g., Country = USA, Browser = Chrome).
    - Selected metrics on the chart.
2.  **Open Segments Menu**: Click on the **Segments** dropdown (bookmark icon) in the top right header.
3.  **Add Segment**: Select **Add a segment**.
4.  **Name It**: Give your segment a descriptive name (e.g., "US Mobile Traffic").
5.  **Save**: Confirm to save your current view.

## Using a Segment

To switch to a saved segment:

1.  Click the **Segments** dropdown.
2.  Select the segment you wish to view from the list.
3.  The dashboard will immediately update to reflect the saved configuration.

## Managing Segments

You can manage your segments directly from the dropdown menu:

- **Edit**: Click the pencil icon next to a segment to rename it or update its configuration.
- **Delete**: Click the trash icon to remove a segment you no longer need.
