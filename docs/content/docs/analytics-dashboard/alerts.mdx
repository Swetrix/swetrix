<Callout type="info" title="Cloud Exclusive">

The Alerts feature is exclusively available on **Swetrix Cloud**. It is not currently available for self-hosted instances at the moment.

</Callout>

Alerts allow you to monitor your website's performance in real-time and receive notifications when specific metrics cross a defined threshold. This helps you stay on top of traffic spikes, server errors, or important user interactions without constantly checking the dashboard.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up alerts, you must connect a notification channel to your account. Swetrix supports the following channels:

- **Telegram**
- **Discord**
- **Slack**

To configure these, go to your **Account Settings** and follow the instructions for each integration. If no channel is connected, you will see a warning on the Alerts page.

## Creating an Alert

1.  Navigate to your project's dashboard and click on the **Alerts** tab.
2.  Click the **Add Alert** button.
3.  Configure the alert settings:
    - **Name**: A descriptive name for your alert (e.g., "High Traffic Warning").
    - **Metric**: The data point you want to monitor (see below).
    - **Condition**: The logic to trigger the alert (e.g., Greater than, Less than).
    - **Value**: The threshold number.
    - **Timeframe**: The period over which the data is analyzed (e.g., "Last 15 minutes").

### Supported Metrics

You can create alerts based on the following metrics:

- **Pageviews**: Total number of pages viewed.
- **Unique Pageviews**: Number of unique visitors.
- **Online Users**: Current number of active users on your site.
- **Custom Events**: Monitor specific interactions (e.g., "Signup Button Click"). You can track a specific event by name or alert on _every_ custom event.
- **Errors**: Track JavaScript errors occurring on your site. You can choose to be notified about all errors or only **new** errors that haven't been seen before.

## Managing Alerts

Once created, your alerts will appear in a list on the Alerts tab.

- **Edit**: Click the **Pencil** icon to modify the alert's threshold or settings.
- **Delete**: Click the **Trash** icon to remove the alert permanently.
- **Status**: Alerts show their last triggered time, helping you understand their frequency.

## Example Use Cases

- **Traffic Spike**: Notify me if **Online Users** is greater than **100**.
- **Error Monitoring**: Notify me on **New Errors** (useful for post-deployment monitoring).
- **Goal Tracking**: Notify me if **Custom Event** "Purchase" count is greater than **10** in the last **1 hour**.
