The Captcha Analytics dashboard provides detailed insights into how users are interacting with the Swetrix CAPTCHA on your website. It helps you monitor completion rates and understand the demographics of users solving your CAPTCHAs.

## Overview

Swetrix offers a privacy-friendly, cookieless CAPTCHA solution that uses a Proof of Work mechanism. This dashboard allows you to track the performance of this feature and ensure legitimate users are successfully accessing your protected content while bots are kept at bay.

## Key Metrics

### Captcha Completions

The main chart displays the **Captcha Completions** metric. This represents the number of times users have successfully solved the CAPTCHA challenge on your site within the selected timeframe.

Visualising this data helps you:

- Monitor traffic spikes that might indicate bot attacks.
- Ensure the CAPTCHA is functioning correctly for legitimate users.
- Correlate CAPTCHA completions with specific events or campaigns.

## Detailed Breakdown

Below the main chart, you can find detailed panels that categorise the CAPTCHA completion data by various dimensions:

### Location

- **Country**: See which countries your CAPTCHA-solving traffic is originating from.

### Devices

- **Browser**: Identify which web browsers are being used to solve CAPTCHAs.
- **Operating System (OS)**: View the operating systems of your users.
- **Device Type**: Breakdown by device category (e.g., Desktop, Mobile, Tablet).

## Filtering and Analysis

As with other dashboards in Swetrix, you can filter the data by clicking on any specific item in the breakdown panels (e.g., filtering to show only CAPTCHA completions from "Mobile" devices).

You can also adjust the time range and time bucket (e.g., hourly, daily) using the controls at the top of the page to analyse trends over different periods.
