The Traffic Analytics dashboard is the core of Swetrix, providing comprehensive insights into your website's visitors, their behavior, and traffic sources. It allows you to visualize data through interactive charts and detailed breakdowns.

## Overview

The Traffic view consolidates all essential metrics into a single, easy-to-read interface. You can track visitor trends, analyze specific segments, and drill down into detailed reports.

### Key Metrics

The main chart visualizes various metrics to help you understand your traffic performance:

- **Sessions (Unique)**: The number of unique visitors to your site within the selected timeframe.
- **Pageviews**: The total number of pages viewed.
- **Session Duration**: The average time visitors spend on your site per session.
- **Bounce Rate**: The percentage of visitors who navigate away from the site after viewing only one page.
- **Views per Unique**: The average number of pages viewed by a single unique visitor.
- **Revenue**: Total revenue generated (if revenue tracking is enabled).

You can also enable **Trendlines** to see the general direction of your data and **Cumulative Mode** to view data accumulation over time.

## Traffic Breakdown

Below the main chart, you will find detailed panels categorizing your traffic data:

### Location

## Custom Events & Metadata

Swetrix allows you to track specific interactions beyond standard pageviews.

- **Custom Events**: A dedicated panel shows the performance of your tracked events (e.g., "Button Clicked", "Form Submitted").
- **Metadata**: You can view detailed breakdowns of metadata attached to both Pageviews and Custom Events in their respective panels.

## Timeframes & Comparisons

You can analyze data over various periods using the time selector in the top right corner:

- **Standard Periods**: Today, Yesterday, Last 7 days, Last 30 days, Month to Date, etc.
- **Custom Range**: Select specific start and end dates.
- **Time Buckets**: Group chart data by Hour, Day, Week, Month, or Year for better trend analysis.

You can also **Compare** the current period with a previous one (e.g., "Previous period" or "Same period last year") to identify growth or decline.

## Segments (Saved Views)

You can save specific filter configurations as **Segments** to quickly access them later. This is useful for frequently analyzing specific user groups, such as "Mobile Users from US" or "Paid Traffic".
