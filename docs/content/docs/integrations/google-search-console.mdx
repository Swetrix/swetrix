# Google Search Console Integration

Swetrix offers a seamless integration with Google Search Console (GSC), allowing you to view your search traffic data directly within your analytics dashboard. This integration bridges the gap between **Search Intent** (what users are looking for) and **On-site Behavior** (how they interact with your site).

## Why connect Google Search Console?

By connecting GSC, you can unlock valuable SEO insights without leaving Swetrix:

- **Keyword Analysis:** See exactly which search queries are driving traffic to your website.
- **Performance Metrics:** Monitor Impressions, Clicks, Click-Through Rate (CTR), and Average Position for each keyword.
- **Privacy-Focused:** View this data alongside your privacy-friendly analytics in a unified interface.

## How to Set Up

</Callout>

1.  **Navigate to Project Settings:**
    Open your project dashboard and click on the **Settings** tab in the navigation menu.

2.  **Go to Integrations:**
    Select the **Integrations** tab from the sidebar menu.

3.  **Connect Google Account:**
    Locate the **Google Search Console** card and click the **Connect** button. You will be redirected to Google to authorize Swetrix to access your Search Console data.

    _Note: We only request read-only access to view your verified sites and search analytics data._

4.  **Select Your Property:**
    Once authenticated, you will be redirected back to the settings page. You will see your linked Google email address.

    Select the correct **Website Property** (domain) from the dropdown menu that corresponds to your Swetrix project.

5.  **Save:**
    Click the **Save** button to finalize the connection.

## Viewing Search Data

Once connected, your search data will automatically populate in your project dashboard.

1.  Go to your Project **Overview**.
2.  Scroll down to the **Traffic** panel (where Sources, Mediums, etc., are listed).
3.  Click on the **Keywords** tab.

You will now see a list of keywords (queries) that users typed into Google to find your site, along with:

- **Clicks:** The number of times users clicked your link.
- **Impressions:** How many times your site appeared in search results.
- **CTR:** The percentage of impressions that resulted in a click.
- **Position:** The average ranking of your site for that query.

This unified view helps you understand the complete marketing funnel: from the initial search intent on Google to the resulting engagement on your website.
