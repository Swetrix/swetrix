Integrate Swetrix with your Carrd site to get privacy-friendly analytics on your one-page website.

## Prerequisites

Adding custom code to a Carrd site requires a **Pro** subscription (Pro Standard, Pro Plus, or Pro Max). If you're on the free plan, you'll need to upgrade before following this guide.

## Installation

### 1. Open your site settings

1. Log in to [Carrd](https://carrd.co) and open the site you want to track in the editor.
2. Click the **gear icon** (Settings) in the top-right corner of the editor.

### 2. Add the tracking script

1. In the settings panel, scroll down to the **Head** section under "Embed Code".
2. Paste the following code:

```html
<script>
  (function () {
    var s = document.createElement("script");
    s.src = "https://swetrix.org/swetrix.js";
    s.defer = true;
    s.onload = function () {
      swetrix.init("YOUR_PROJECT_ID");
      swetrix.trackViews();
    };
    document.head.appendChild(s);
  })();
</script>

<noscript>
  <img
    src="https://api.swetrix.com/log/noscript?pid=YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
    alt=""
    referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"
  />
</noscript>
```

We use the JavaScript approach (dynamically creating the script element) instead of a plain `<script src="...">` tag because Carrd may strip `defer` or other attributes during processing.

### 3. Publish your site

Click **Save**, then **Publish** to apply the changes to your live site.

<Callout type="warn">
Don't forget to replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with your actual Project ID from the Swetrix dashboard, otherwise tracking won't work.

</Callout>

## Check your installation

Open your published Carrd site in a new tab (or an incognito window). Within a minute you should see a pageview appear in your Swetrix dashboard.

<Callout type="info">
The tracking script only runs on your published site. You won't see analytics data while previewing inside the Carrd editor.

</Callout>

## Multiple pages

If your Carrd site uses multiple pages (available on Pro Plus and Pro Max plans), the tracking script in the head code loads on every page automatically — no extra configuration needed.

## Optional: track custom events

You can use `swetrix.track()` to capture custom interactions such as button clicks or form submissions. Add the following in the same **Head** embed code section, after the main tracking snippet:

```html
<script>
  document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
    var form = document.querySelector("form");
    if (!form || typeof swetrix === "undefined") return;

    form.addEventListener("submit", function () {
      swetrix.track({ ev: "form_submission" });
    });
  });
</script>
```

Refer to the [tracking script reference](/swetrix-js-reference) for the full list of options and functions available.

## Troubleshooting

- **Script not loading.** Verify you have a Carrd Pro subscription — custom code is not available on the free plan.
- **No data in dashboard.** Make sure you published the site after adding the embed code. Changes in the editor are not live until you publish.
- **Check the source.** Open your published site, right-click and select "View Page Source", then search for `swetrix` to confirm the script is present.
- **Console errors.** Open your browser's developer tools (F12) and check the Console tab for JavaScript errors. Look for network requests to `api.swetrix.com` to verify data is being sent.
