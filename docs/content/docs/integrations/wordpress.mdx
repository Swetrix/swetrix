After you sign up on Swetrix and create a new project, the only thing left is to add it to your website.

## Installation

<Steps>
<Step>
### Log in to Wordpress

Log in to your Wordpress account.

### Install a code injection plugin

Install a plugin for adding the code to your HTML, for instance the [Insert Headers and Footers plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/insert-headers-and-footers).

</Step>
<Step>
### Open the Custom Code section

Open up your project, go to the `Project Settings > Custom Code` section.

</Step>
<Step>
### Add the script to the header

To the `Scripts in Header` section you need to add the following:

```html
<script src="https://swetrix.org/swetrix.js" defer></script>
```

</Step>
<Step>
### Add the initialisation to the footer

In the `Scripts in Footer` section you need to add the following:

```html
<script>
  document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
    swetrix.init("YOUR_PROJECT_ID");
    swetrix.trackViews();
  });
</script>

<noscript>
  <img
    src="https://api.swetrix.com/log/noscript?pid=YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
    alt=""
    referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"
  />
</noscript>
```

</Step>

<Callout type="warn">
It's very important not to forget to replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with your actual Project ID you can find in the Dashboard, otherwise tracking won't work!

## Check your installation

After installing Swetrix tracking script, go to your website and visit some pages.

Within a minute you should be able to see new pageviews being added to your project's dahsboard.
