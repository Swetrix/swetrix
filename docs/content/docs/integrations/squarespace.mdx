Integrate Swetrix with your Squarespace website using the built-in Code Injection feature.

## Prerequisites

Squarespace's Code Injection feature is available on **Business** and **Commerce** plans. If you're on a Personal plan, you'll need to upgrade before following this guide.

## Installation

### 1. Open Code Injection settings

1. Log in to your Squarespace account and open the site you want to track.
2. From the Home Menu, navigate to **Settings > Advanced > Code Injection**.

### 2. Add the Swetrix script

In the **Header** field, paste the following to load the Swetrix library:

```html
<script src="https://swetrix.org/swetrix.js" defer></script>
```

### 3. Add the initialisation snippet

In the **Footer** field, paste the following to initialise tracking:

```html
<script>
  document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
    swetrix.init("YOUR_PROJECT_ID");
    swetrix.trackViews();
  });
</script>

<noscript>
  <img
    src="https://api.swetrix.com/log/noscript?pid=YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
    alt=""
    referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"
  />
</noscript>
```

### 4. Save

Click **Save** at the top of the Code Injection panel.

<Callout type="warn">
Don't forget to replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with your actual Project ID from the Swetrix dashboard, otherwise tracking won't work.

</Callout>

## Check your installation

After saving, open your Squarespace site in a new tab (or an incognito window) and browse a few pages. Within a minute you should see new pageviews appearing in your Swetrix dashboard.

<Callout type="info">
The tracking script only runs on your live published site. You won't see analytics data while previewing pages inside the Squarespace editor.

</Callout>

## Optional: track custom events

You can use `swetrix.track()` to capture custom interactions — button clicks, form submissions, video plays, etc. Add any extra tracking calls in the same **Footer** code block, after `swetrix.trackViews()`.

For example, to track newsletter sign-ups:

```html
<script>
  document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
    var form = document.querySelector(".newsletter-block form");
    if (!form || typeof swetrix === "undefined") return;

    form.addEventListener("submit", function () {
      swetrix.track({ ev: "newsletter_signup" });
    });
  });
</script>
```

Refer to the [tracking script reference](/swetrix-js-reference) for the full list of options and functions available.

## Important considerations

- **Plan requirement.** Code Injection is not available on Squarespace Personal plans. You need a Business or Commerce plan.
- **Template changes.** Switching your Squarespace template does not remove Code Injection snippets — they persist across template changes.
- **Single-page navigation.** Some Squarespace templates use AJAX-style page loading (page transitions without a full reload). Swetrix's `trackViews()` handles this automatically via the History API, so no extra configuration is needed.
- **Testing.** Use your browser's developer console to confirm the script is loaded and check for JavaScript errors. Look for network requests to `api.swetrix.com` to verify data is being sent.
