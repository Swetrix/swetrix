Integrate Swetrix with your Weebly website using the built-in Header/Footer Code feature.

## Prerequisites

Adding custom code to Weebly requires a **paid plan** (Personal, Professional, Performance, or any Business plan). The free plan does not support custom header/footer code injection.

## Installation

### 1. Open your site's code settings

1. Log in to your [Weebly](https://www.weebly.com) account and open the site editor.
2. Click **Settings** in the top menu.
3. Select the **SEO** tab.

### 2. Add the Swetrix script

In the **Header Code** field, paste the following:

```html
<script src="https://swetrix.org/swetrix.js" defer></script>
```

### 3. Add the initialisation snippet

In the **Footer Code** field, paste the following:

```html
<script>
  document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
    swetrix.init("YOUR_PROJECT_ID");
    swetrix.trackViews();
  });
</script>

<noscript>
  <img
    src="https://api.swetrix.com/log/noscript?pid=YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
    alt=""
    referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"
  />
</noscript>
```

### 4. Save and publish

Click **Save**, then **Publish** your site to apply the changes.

<Callout type="warn">
Don't forget to replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with your actual Project ID from the Swetrix dashboard, otherwise tracking won't work.

</Callout>

## Check your installation

After publishing, open your Weebly site in a new tab (or an incognito window) and browse a few pages. Within a minute you should see new pageviews appearing in your Swetrix dashboard.

<Callout type="info">
The tracking script only runs on your published site. You won't see analytics data while previewing inside the Weebly editor.

</Callout>

## Optional: track custom events

You can use `swetrix.track()` to capture custom interactions — button clicks, form submissions, etc. Add the following in the same **Footer Code** field, after the main tracking snippet:

```html
<script>
  document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
    var form = document.querySelector("form");
    if (!form || typeof swetrix === "undefined") return;

    form.addEventListener("submit", function () {
      swetrix.track({ ev: "form_submission" });
    });
  });
</script>
```

Refer to the [tracking script reference](/swetrix-js-reference) for the full list of options and functions available.

## Troubleshooting

- **No Header/Footer Code option.** This feature is only available on paid Weebly plans. Upgrade from the free plan to access it.
- **No data in dashboard.** Make sure you published the site after adding the code. Changes are not live until you publish.
- **Check the source.** Open your published site, right-click and select "View Page Source", then search for `swetrix` to confirm the script is present.
- **Console errors.** Open your browser's developer tools (F12) and check the Console tab for JavaScript errors. Look for network requests to `api.swetrix.com` to verify data is being sent.
