Integrate Swetrix with your [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/) documentation site to understand how visitors navigate your docs, which pages get the most attention, and where readers drop off — all with full privacy and GDPR compliance.

## Prerequisites

GitBook's custom script injection requires:

- A **Pro**, **Team**, or **Enterprise** plan. Custom scripts are not available on the free Community plan.
- A **custom domain** configured for your GitBook space. Scripts only execute on custom domains, not on default `*.gitbook.io` URLs.

## Installation

### 1. Open your space settings

1. Navigate to the GitBook space you want to track.
2. Click the **Settings** icon (gear) in the top-right corner.
3. Select **Integrations** from the sidebar.

### 2. Add the tracking script

1. Scroll down to the **Custom scripts** section.
2. In the **Head** field, paste the following:

```html
<script src="https://swetrix.org/swetrix.js" defer></script>
<script>
  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
    swetrix.init('YOUR_PROJECT_ID')
    swetrix.trackViews()
  })
</script>
```

### 3. Save

Click **Save** to apply the script to your documentation site.


<Callout type="warn">
Don't forget to replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with your actual Project ID from the [Swetrix dashboard](https://swetrix.com/projects), otherwise tracking won't work.

</Callout>

### Noscript fallback (optional)

If the Head section supports multiple code blocks, you can also add a noscript pixel to track visitors who have JavaScript disabled:

```html
<noscript>
  <img
    src="https://api.swetrix.com/log/noscript?pid=YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
    alt=""
    referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"
  />
</noscript>
```

## Check your installation

Open your documentation site through your custom domain in a new browser tab or incognito window. Browse through a few pages. Within a minute you should see new pageviews appearing in your Swetrix dashboard.


<Callout type="info">
Make sure you're accessing the site via your custom domain, not the default `*.gitbook.io` URL. Custom scripts only load on custom domains.

</Callout>

## Page navigation tracking

GitBook uses client-side navigation when readers move between pages. Swetrix's `trackViews()` handles this automatically via the History API, so every page transition is captured without any extra configuration.

## Error tracking

You can enable automatic client-side error monitoring by adding `trackErrors()` alongside the other initialisation calls. This captures unhandled JavaScript errors and reports them to Swetrix.

Update the script in your Head section:

```html
<script src="https://swetrix.org/swetrix.js" defer></script>
<script>
  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
    swetrix.init('YOUR_PROJECT_ID')
    swetrix.trackViews()
    swetrix.trackErrors()
  })
</script>
```

Errors will appear in the **Errors** tab of your project dashboard. See the [tracking script reference](/swetrix-js-reference#trackerrors) for configuration options like `sampleRate` and `callback`.

## Troubleshooting

### Script not loading

- **Check your plan.** Custom scripts require a Pro plan or higher. Verify your GitBook subscription.
- **Verify your custom domain.** Scripts only execute on custom domains. If you're viewing your docs at `yourspace.gitbook.io`, the script won't run.
- **Inspect the source.** Open your published site on your custom domain, right-click and select "View Page Source", then search for `swetrix` to confirm the script is present.

### No data in dashboard

- **Confirm the Project ID.** Double-check that `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` is replaced with your actual project ID from the Swetrix dashboard.
- **Check the console.** Open your browser's developer tools (F12) and look at the Console tab for JavaScript errors. Check the Network tab for requests to `api.swetrix.com` to verify data is being sent.

### Changes not appearing

GitBook may cache pages aggressively. Try:

- Hard-refreshing the page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R).
- Opening the site in an incognito or private window.
- Waiting a few minutes for the cache to update.
