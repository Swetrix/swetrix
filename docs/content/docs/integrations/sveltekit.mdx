After you sign up on Swetrix and create a new project, the only thing left is to add it to your website.

## Installation

<Steps>
<Step>
### Install the Swetrix package

```bash
npm install swetrix
```

</Step>
<Step>
### Create or update your layout file

Go to your SvelteKit website codebase and either create a new `+layout.svelte` file or use an existing one.
Make your layout file look like this:

```html
<script>
  import { onMount } from "svelte";
  import { dev } from "$app/environment";
  import * as Swetrix from "swetrix";

  onMount(() => {
    Swetrix.init("YOUR_PROJECT_ID", { devMode: dev, disabled: dev });
    Swetrix.trackViews();
  });
</script>

<!-- Your site's content gets injected here -->
<slot />
```

`trackViews()` automatically detects client-side route changes, so you only need to call it once.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warn">
It's very important not to forget to replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with your actual Project ID you can find in the Dashboard, otherwise tracking won't work!

</Callout>

## Check your installation

After installing Swetrix tracking script, go to your website and visit some pages.

Within a minute you should be able to see new pageviews being added to your project's dahsboard.
