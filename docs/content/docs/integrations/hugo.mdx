After you sign up on Swetrix and create a new project, the only thing left is to add it to your website.

## Installation

The recommended approach is to create a Hugo partial template for the Swetrix tracking script and include it in your site's base layout.

### 1. Create a partial template

In your Hugo project, create the file `layouts/partials/swetrix-analytics.html` with the following content:

```html
{{ if not .Site.IsServer }}
<script src="https://swetrix.org/swetrix.js" defer></script>
<script>
  document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
    swetrix.init("YOUR_PROJECT_ID");
    swetrix.trackViews();
  });
</script>

<noscript>
  <img
    src="https://api.swetrix.com/log/noscript?pid=YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
    alt=""
    referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"
  />
</noscript>
{{ end }}
```

The `{{ if not .Site.IsServer }}` condition ensures the tracking script is only included in production builds (`hugo`) and not during local development (`hugo server`). This prevents inflating your analytics with local page views.

<Callout type="warn">
It's very important not to forget to replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with your actual Project ID you can find in the Dashboard, otherwise tracking won't work!

</Callout>

### 2. Include the partial in your layout

Open your base layout template — typically `layouts/_default/baseof.html`. If your theme provides one, you may need to copy it into your project's `layouts/` directory first to override it.

Add the partial just before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
    {{ partial "swetrix-analytics.html" . }}
  </body>
</html>
```

## Using Hugo config parameters (optional)

To keep your Project ID out of the template and make it easy to manage across environments, you can use Hugo's site parameters instead.

Update `layouts/partials/swetrix-analytics.html`:

```html
{{ if and (not .Site.IsServer) .Site.Params.swetrixProjectID }}
<script src="https://swetrix.org/swetrix.js" defer></script>
<script>
  document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
    swetrix.init("{{ .Site.Params.swetrixProjectID }}");
    swetrix.trackViews();
  });
</script>

<noscript>
  <img
    src="https://api.swetrix.com/log/noscript?pid={{ .Site.Params.swetrixProjectID }}"
    alt=""
    referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"
  />
</noscript>
{{ end }}
```

Then add your Project ID to your Hugo configuration file.

**config.toml:**

```toml
[params]
  swetrixProjectID = "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
```

**config.yaml:**

```yaml
params:
  swetrixProjectID: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
```

## Check your installation

After installing Swetrix tracking script, build your site with `hugo` and deploy it.

Visit your live website and navigate through a few pages. Within a minute you should be able to see new pageviews being added to your project's dashboard.
