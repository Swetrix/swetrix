## How it works

The email report is a digest that includes data for all the projects you have access to. It provides a quick overview of the key metrics for each project, allowing you to monitor trends and identify potential issues.

The report includes the following metrics for each project:

- **Active Users**: The number of people currently on your website.
- **Unique Visitors**: The number of distinct individuals who have visited your website.
- **Pageviews**: The total number of pages viewed.
- **Avg. Session Duration**: The average length of a visit to your website.
- **Bounce Rate**: The percentage of visitors who navigate away from the site after viewing only one page.
- **Goal Conversions**: If you have set up goals, the report will show the number of conversions and the conversion rate.
- **Errors Detected**: If you are using error tracking, the report will include a summary of the errors detected.
- **Top Country**: The country from which most of your traffic originates.

<Callout type="info">
If you want to invite other people (like your team members or clients) to receive reports for a specific website, you should use the [site-specific email reports feature](/how-to-invite-users-to-your-website) instead. The account-level email reports described here are intended for your personal overview of all your projects.
