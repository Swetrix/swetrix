API keys allow you to authenticate with the Swetrix API programmatically. You can use them to retrieve statistics, manage your account, and more.

1.  Go to your **[Account Settings](https://swetrix.com/user-settings)**.
2.  Open the **Account** tab.
3.  Scroll down to the **API Key** section.
4.  Click the **Generate new API key** button.

Your new API key will be displayed.


<Callout type="warn">
Treat your API key like a password. Do not share it publicly or commit it to version control systems.

## Deleting an API Key

If your API key is compromised or you no longer need it, you can delete it:

1.  Navigate to the **API Key** section in your [Account Settings](https://swetrix.com/user-settings).
2.  Click the **Delete API key** button.
3.  Confirm the deletion in the modal window.

Once deleted, any applications or scripts using this key will no longer be able to access the API.

## Using the API Key

You can use your API key to authenticate requests to the Swetrix API. For more information on available endpoints and how to use them, please refer to the [Statistics API reference](/statistics-api).

Example usage:

```bash
curl 'https://api.swetrix.com/v1/log?pid=YOUR_PROJECT_ID&timeBucket=day&period=7d' \
  -H "X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```
