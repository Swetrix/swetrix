## Introduction

You can use the CAPTCHA widget on any page of your website by using our CAPTCHA loader widget. Swetrix CAPTCHA relies on JavaScript to work, so you have to include the widget on your page.

## Installation

<Tabs items={["CDN", "npm"]}>
<Tab value="CDN">

The easiest way to add the CAPTCHA script to your website is to edit the HTML code of your website. To do this, paste the following code snippet into the header section (`<head>` tag) of your website:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.swetrixcaptcha.com/captcha-loader.js" defer></script>
```

</Tab>
<Tab value="npm">

**Not yet supported**

</Tabs>

## Usage

Once the CAPTCHA script is installed (or embedded) on your website, you can use the CAPTCHA widget by adding the following HTML code to your page:

```html
<div class="swecaptcha" data-project-id="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"></div>
```

Inside the `.swecaptcha` element, the widget will automatically render a frame with the CAPTCHA challenge and an input field where the token will be stored. The CAPTCHA is designed to be embedded to HTML forms, but you can use it anywhere on your website.

After the CAPTCHA loader script is loaded, it will add a `window.swetrixCaptchaForceLoad` function to the global scope. You can use this function to forcefully reload the CAPTCHA widget. This function can be useful if you changed the CAPTCHA configuration and want to reload the widget without reloading the page.

### Customisation

You can customise the appearance of the CAPTCHA widget by adding the following attributes to the `.swecaptcha` element:

| Attribute                  | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `data-project-id`          | string | The ID of your CAPTCHA project (REQUIRED).                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `data-theme`               | string | The theme of the CAPTCHA widget. Possible values: `auto` (default), `light`, `dark`.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `data-response-input-name` | string | Name of the token input element. Default: `swetrix-captcha-response`.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `data-api-url`             | string | The URL of the CAPTCHA API. Default: `https://api.swetrixcaptcha.com/v1/captcha`. If you're self-hosting Swetrix CE, you should put the URL of your API instance here, like `[BASE_URL]/backend/v1/captcha`. Swetrix Cloud users should leave it as is. |
| `data-lang`                | string | Force a specific language for the widget (see [Language support](#language-support)).                                                                                                                                                                   |

### Language support

The CAPTCHA widget supports the following languages:

| Language  | Code |
| --------- | ---- |
| English   | `en` |
| German    | `de` |
| French    | `fr` |
| Polish    | `pl` |
| Ukrainian | `uk` |

#### Automatic language detection

The widget automatically detects the language to use based on the following priority:

1. **Widget `data-lang` attribute**: If the `data-lang` attribute is set on the `.swecaptcha` element, that language is used.
2. **HTML `lang` attribute**: The widget looks at the first HTML `lang` attribute it finds in its parent elements (e.g., `<html lang="de">`).
3. **Browser language**: If no `lang` attribute is found above the widget or an unsupported language is requested, the language is determined by the browser's preferred language. This is usually the user's operating system language.

#### Forcing a specific language

To force a specific language, set the `data-lang` attribute on the widget element:

```html
<div class="swecaptcha" data-project-id="YOUR_PROJECT_ID" data-lang="de"></div>
```

This will display the widget in German regardless of the page's language or the user's browser settings.

### Widget sizes

The CAPTCHA widget has a default size of 302px wide and 66px high.
