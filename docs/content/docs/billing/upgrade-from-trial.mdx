## Updating to a paid subscription

<Steps>
<Step>
### Choose a plan

Log in to your account and go to the [billing page](https://swetrix.com/billing).

You will see the Plan usage section with an indicator of how many events you used during the current calendar month. You can hover over this chart and see what kind of events you used during that period.

We count pageviews, error events, and custom events as "events".

Using the subscription plan selector, choose a plan based on your estimated usage, and the billing frequency (monthly or yearly). You can get 2 free months with a yearly subscription.

</Step>
<Step>
### Start the upgrade

Once you choose your subscription plan, click on the "Upgrade" button to get started.

## Opt into company VAT refund for your subscription

You can add your company details and VAT ID when subscribing to one of our plans. If you're eligible, no VAT or other sales taxes will be added to your subscription price.

You can also add your VAT number after you created a subscription, to do that open the invoice Paddle sent you to your email address, and click on the "Add address & VAT Number" button.
