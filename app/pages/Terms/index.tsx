        <h3 className='text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 tracking-tight mt-4'>Subscriptions</h3>
        <p className='text-lg text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 tracking-tight'>
          Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.
          <br />
          At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or we cancel it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting our customer support team.
          <br />
          A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide us with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize us to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.
          <br />
          Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, we may issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.
        </p>

        <h3 className='text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 tracking-tight mt-4'>Fee changes</h3>
        <p className='text-lg text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 tracking-tight'>
          We may, at our sole discretion and at any time, modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
          <br />
          We will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.
          <br />
          Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.
        </p>

        <h3 className='text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 tracking-tight mt-4'>Refunds</h3>
        <p className='text-lg text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 tracking-tight'>
          To avoid being charged for your Subscription, you must cancel the Subscription before your renewal date. Otherwise, you’ll be charged and will retain access to the Service through the end of the Billing Cycle.
          <br />
          Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable. However, you may contact our support team and at our sole discretion we may issue a refund on a case-by-case basis.
        </p>

        {/* <h3 className='text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 tracking-tight mt-4'>Service Level Agreement (SLA)</h3>
          <p className='text-lg text-gray-900 tracking-tight'>
            If you purchased a Subscription with a SLA, we aim to provide Service availability of 99.5% or better. If downtime in any one month exceeds 0.5% of that month, we will credit your account. Service credits are applied at your request and will apply toward the balance due at the end of the next Billing Cycle (either monthly or yearly).<br />
            We will apply any service credits only against future payments for the services otherwise due from you. Service credits will not entitle you to any refund or other payment from us. A service credit will be applicable and issued only if the credit amount for the applicable billing cycle is greater than one euro (€1). Service credits may not be transferred or applied to any other account.<br />
            Service credits are calculated as a percentage of the total charges paid by you (excluding one-time payments such as upfront payments) for the month in which the downtime occurred in accordance with the schedule below. For yearly billing, the total charge paid by the user is divided into 12 equal parts, each corresponding to a month unit for the purpose of the service credits calculation.<br />
            We calculate service credits the following way:<br />
              - If the monthly uptime is less than 99.5% but equal to or greater than 98.5%, the service credit is equal to 10% of the Service’s monthly cost.<br />
              - If the monthly uptime is less than 98.5%, the service credit is equal to 30% of the Service’s monthly cost.<br />

            Some performance issues are excluded from downtime calculations, such as:<br />
              - Issues caused by factors outside of our reasonable control.<br />
              - Issues that resulted from any actions or inaction by a user or a third-party.<br />
              - Issues that resulted from the user’s equipment and/or third-party equipment (not within our primary control). For the avoidance of any doubt, we do not provide any Internet or network services and any performance issues related to that type of services shall be deemed not in the primary control of the Company.<br />
              - Issues that arise from the Company’s suspension or termination of rights to use the Service in accordance with these Terms.<br />
              - Downtime caused by reasonable scheduled maintenance that is announced in advance.

          Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an obligation under this Agreement shall not affect a party’s ability to exercise such right or require such performance at any time thereafter, nor shall the waiver of a breach constitute the waiver of any subsequent breach.
